### Key Technologies
- **Frontend:** React Native with Expo
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Real-time)
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Navigation:** React Navigation
- **Maps:** React Native Maps
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth

---

## Authentication System

### Initial Implementation
- **SignInScreen.js** - User login interface
- **SignUpScreen.js** - User registration interface
- **authStore.js** - Centralized authentication state management

### Features Implemented
- Email/password authentication
- Session persistence
- User profile management

### UI Improvements
**Issue:** Sign-in/sign-up forms appeared narrow
**Solution:** Progressive width adjustments
1. Initial: 90% width
2. Updated to: 95% width
3. Final: 100% width with proper margins and padding
4. Fixed ScrollView constraints for optimal display

---

## UI/UX Improvements

### Navigation Bar Enhancement
**Goal:** Make navigation more modern and animated

**Changes Made:**
- Added animated icons with smooth transitions
- Implemented pulsing FAB (Floating Action Button) effect
- Applied gradient backgrounds
- Enhanced visual feedback for active states
- Fixed chat icon animation (resolved "Chat" vs "ChatList" string mismatch)

**Result:** Modern, engaging navigation with smooth animations

### Form Layout Optimization
**Issue:** Forms appeared cramped and narrow
**Resolution:** 
- Adjusted container widths progressively
- Optimized ScrollView constraints
- Improved centering and spacing
- Enhanced responsive design

---

## Property Management Features

### Core Functionality
- Property listing and search
- Property details view
- Add new properties
- Property filtering and sorting
- Location-based search using Bangladesh geocoding data

### Components Developed
- **PropertyCard.js** - Individual property display
- **PropertiesMap.js** - Map view of properties
- **PropertyDetailScreen.js** - Detailed property view
- **AddPropertyScreen.js** - Property creation form
- **SearchFilters.js** - Search and filter interface

---

## Database Schema Evolution

### Phase 1: User Authentication
**Table:** `users` (Supabase Auth)
- Standard auth fields (email, password, etc.)
- User profile information

### Phase 2: Property Management
**Table:** `properties`
- Property details (title, description, price, location)
- Image URLs
- Owner information
- Timestamps

### Phase 3: User Preferences
**Added Columns to `users` table:**

#### Favorites System
```sql
-- Column: favorites (JSONB)
-- Index: favorites_gin_idx
-- Purpose: Store favorite property IDs
```

**Implementation:**
- Updated `authStore.js` with favorites management
- Added async functions for database sync
- Integrated with PropertyCard for favorite toggling
- Updated ProfileScreen to display favorites

#### My Properties System
```sql
-- Column: myproperties (JSONB)
-- Index: myproperties_gin_idx
-- Purpose: Store user's posted property IDs
```

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced `authStore.js` with myproperties functions
- Updated ProfileScreen to filter user's properties
- Modified AddPropertyScreen to auto-add to myproperties
- Created migration script for existing users

### Migration Strategy
- Created comprehensive migration script
- Handled existing users gracefully
- Maintained data integrity during schema changes

---

## Navigation & User Experience

### MainStack.js Evolution
**Initial Issue:** Navigation errors with 'SignIn' screen
**Problem:** Conditional screen inclusion causing navigation failures
**Solution:** Always include all screens, use conditional rendering for navigator content

### Guest Mode Implementation
**Goal:** Allow users to browse without authentication

**Features:**
- "Continue as Guest" button in SignInScreen
- Limited access to core features
- Graceful degradation for restricted features
- Clear upgrade prompts for full functionality

**Navigation Logic:**
- Guest users can access Home and Profile
- Restricted screens show informative alerts
- Profile shows guest mode welcome screen
- Seamless transition to full authentication

---

## Performance Optimizations

### ProfileScreen Optimization
**Issue:** Slow loading times
**Root Causes:**
- Multiple sequential API calls
- Heavy data processing in render
- Lack of memoization
- Inefficient re-renders

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Memoized expensive calculations
- Parallel data fetching
- Optimized loading states
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented proper error handling

**Result:** Significantly improved loading performance

### State Management Improvements
- Centralized authentication state
- Efficient data caching
- Optimized re-render patterns
- Better error handling and recovery

---

## Guest Mode Implementation

### Core Features
1. **Access Control**
   - Home screen: Full access
   - Profile screen: Guest welcome interface
   - Other screens: Informative restriction alerts

2. **User Experience**
   - Clear guest mode indicators
   - Smooth navigation flow
   - Upgrade prompts for full features
   - Persistent guest state

3. **Navigation Integration**
   - Updated BottomNav for guest users
   - Profile icon shows guest options
   - Seamless authentication flow

### Technical Implementation
- Enhanced authStore with guest mode handling
- Updated navigation logic in MainStack
- Modified screen components for guest compatibility
- Added proper state management for guest users

---

## Bug Fixes & Resolutions

### 1. Navigation Errors
**Issue:** 'SignIn' screen not being handled
**Root Cause:** Conditional screen inclusion in MainStack
**Fix:** Always include all screens, use conditional rendering for content

### 2. Guest Mode Navigation
**Issue:** "Continue as Guest" button not working
**Root Cause:** Missing forced navigation after guest mode activation
**Fix:** Added immediate navigation after setting guest mode

### 3. Guest Mode UI Issues
**Issue:** Navigation bar disappearing and profile icon not working
**Root Cause:** Incomplete guest mode navigation logic
**Fix:** Updated navigation logic and profile screen for guest users

### 4. Database Column Conflicts
**Issue:** "myproperties" column already exists
**Resolution:** Confirmed columns and indexes exist, no further changes needed

### 5. Chat Icon Animation
**Issue:** Chat icon not animating in navigation
**Root Cause:** String mismatch ("Chat" vs "ChatList")
**Fix:** Corrected active state string matching
